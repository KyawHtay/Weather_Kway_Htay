# Weather_Kway_Htay

Create a simple n-tier weather web application which displays weather information for the week. 

- Front end written in Angular
- Use ASP.Net Core and C# for the server side. 
- The server code should access the weather API and store the result.
- Use the free API [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for the data.
- Please either mock or use a local database.
- Use Entity Framework.
- Create a server side REST API which is called from the front end.
- Follow best practices. 

The UI will allow the selection of at least two cities. Support the selection of different data points, e.g. temperature, rain, wind etc. Display a week of data. 

Push the code to GitHub 

Please see BBC weather for inspiration but we are not expecting images, text is fine. [BBC Weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743)

We are not looking for a finished application. Please don't spend more than a couple of hours coding. The idea is that we can discuss your approch at the next interview.
